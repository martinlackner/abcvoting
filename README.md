## A Python library of approval-based committee (ABC) rules

**A**pproval-**b**ased **c**ommittee rules (ABC rules) are voting methods for selecting a committee, i.e., a fixed-size subset of candidates.
ABC rules are also known as approval-based multi-winner rules.
The input of such rules are
[approval ballots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting#/media/File:Approval_ballot.svg).
We recommend the book
([Multi-Winner Voting with Approval Preferences](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-09016-5))
by Lackner and Skowron [2] as a detailed introduction to ABC rules and related research directions.
In addition, the
[survey by Faliszewski et al.](http://research.illc.uva.nl/COST-IC1205/BookDocs/Chapters/TrendsCOMSOC-02.pdf) [1]
is useful as a more general introduction to committee voting (not limited to approval ballots).

The following ABC rules are implemented:

* Approval Voting (AV)

* Satisfaction Approval Voting (SAV)

* Proportional Approval Voting (PAV)

* Sequential Proportional Approval Voting (seq-PAV)

* Reverse Sequential Proportional Approval Voting (revseq-PAV)

* Approval Chamberlin-Courant (CC)

* Phragmén's sequential rule

* Monroe's rule

* Minimax Approval Voting (MAV)

* Greedy Monroe

* Method of Equal Shares (Rule X)

* Phragmén's First Method (Enestr&ouml;m's Method)

* and many more ...

In addition, one can verify axiomatic properties such as

* Justified Representation (JR)

* Propotional Justified Representation (PJR)

* Extended Justified Representation (EJR)

* Priceability

* The core property


## Installation

As simple as:

```bash
pip install abcvoting
```

Further details can be found [here](https://abcvoting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

## Development

Install all dependencies including development requirements and the abcvoting package in
[development mode](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html):

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Basic unit tests can be run by excluding tests which require additional dependencies:

```bash
pytest  -m "not mipgurobi and not gmpy2 and not slow" tests/
```

For development, configure the black formatter and pre-commit hooks - see below. Also installing
all optional dependencies is recommended.

A development package is build for every commit on the master branch and uploaded to the test
instance of PyPI. It can be installed using the following command:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple abcvoting
```


### Black formatting

Code needs to be formatted using the [black formatter](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). This is
checked by Github actions.
[Configure your editor](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/editors.html) to run the
black formatter.

### Pre-commit hooks

Pre-commit hooks are not required, but they are recommended for development.
[Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is used to manage and maintain pre-commit hooks. Install
pre-commit (e.g. via apt, conda or pip) and then run `$ pre-commit install` to install the hooks.
