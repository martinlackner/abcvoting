Proportional Approval Voting (PAV)
----------------------------------

Algorithm: branch-and-bound

Optimal PAV-score: 19

1 winning committee:
 {a, c}

-------------------------------------------------
Sequential Proportional Approval Voting (seq-PAV)
-------------------------------------------------

Computing only one winning committee (resolute=True)

Algorithm: Standard algorithm

starting with the empty committee (score = 0)

adding candidate number 1: d
 score increases by 11 to a total of 11

adding candidate number 2: c
 score increases by 15/2 to a total of 37/2

1 winning committee:
 {c, d}

PAV-score of winning committee(s):
 {c, d}: 37/2


------------------------------------------------------------
Reverse Sequential Proportional Approval Voting (revseq-PAV)
------------------------------------------------------------

Computing only one winning committee (resolute=True)

Algorithm: Standard algorithm

full committee (4 candidates) has a total score of 30

removing candidate number 1: a
 score decreases by 9/2 to a total of 51/2

removing candidate number 2: b
 score decreases by 7 to a total of 37/2

1 winning committee:
 {c, d}

PAV-score of winning committee: 37/2
