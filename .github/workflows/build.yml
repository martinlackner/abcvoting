    # TODO Can we make this workflow depend on unittests to avoid building broken packages?
    # As it seems: no, we cannot. At least not really. Jobs can depend on other jobs, but workflows
    # cannot depend on other workflows. But jobs cannot be triggered by events, only workflows are
    # triggered by events. That means we would need to run the build/upload job for every commit
    # and every Python version and then check if it is the right Python version and if there is a
    # new tag and only then really upload a package.
    # The only additional advantage of this approach might be that we could test the package
    # building process for every commit and every Python version comfortably.
    #
    # Note: building the package is also tested in unittests.yml.
